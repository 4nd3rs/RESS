This folder is used for Filesystem caching, if WurflCloudCache_File is used.
It must be writable by the webserver process.  This can be accomplished on
Linux by using the following command from this directory:

chmod -R 0777 ./

If PHP Safe Mode is enabled, your webserver user must also own this directory.
Usually the command for this is:

chown -R www-data ./

It is possible that your webserver runs under a user other than 'www-data', like
'nobody' or 'apache'

If all else fails you can tell WurflCloudCache to use the system temp directory by
editing your script and setting the cache_path property like this:

$cache = new WurflCloudCache_File();
$cache->cache_path = WurflCloudCache_File::getSystemTempDir();
